I enjoy:
- *Capture the flag* hacking games where one tries to break into a vulnerable piece of software or operating system as I like testing both my problem solving and technical abilities.
- Creatively solving problems by writing scripts and programs writing.

I am currently studying:
- A MSc in Cyber Security Engineering 

I am looking to study:
- My OSCP
- and happy to collaborate on any pentration testing projects!
